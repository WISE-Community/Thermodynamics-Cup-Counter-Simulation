# Thermodynamics Cup Counter Simulation
A model simulating the heat transfer between a hot cup and a cold counter.

## Development

You will need NPM (https://www.npmjs.com) and Git.

1. Checkout the project
```
$ git clone https://github.com/WISE-Community/Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation.git
```

2. Install gulp globally
```
$ cd Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation
Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation$ npm install -g gulp-cli
```

3. Install dependencies
```
Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation$ npm install
```

4. Start gulp task. This will start a running process to copy files and compile changes to typescript files.
```
Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation$ gulp
```

5. See the model on the browser by going to path_to_Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation/dist/index.html . (e.g. file:///Users/myusername/dev/Thermodynamics-Cup-Counter-Simulation/dist/index.html)

6. Make changes with your favorite IDE. Changes to typescript will be immediately compiled to the dist folder. If you make any other changes, you will need to restart gulp for now.
